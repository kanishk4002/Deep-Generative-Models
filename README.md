# Deep Generative Models (DGM) - Summer of Code 2024

Welcome to the Deep Generative Models (DGM) project repository for the Summer of Code 2024, mentored by Aryan Bhosale. This repository contains the code and documentation for various assignments and projects related to deep generative models.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to explore and implement various deep generative models. Throughout the summer, we will work on different assignments and projects to understand and enhance the performance of these models. The focus will be on practical implementation, experimentation, and thorough documentation of the results.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)

#### Summary

- **Objective**: Train a DCGAN, document the loss curves and minimum error, enhance the model to achieve better accuracy, and compare the generated images.
- **Files**:
  - `Assignment1_DCGAN.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the assignment.
  - `Assignment1_DCGAN.pdf`: Documentation with results and observations.

### Documentation

All the documentation related to the assignments and projects, including detailed explanations, loss curves, error metrics, and sample images, will be maintained in the respective folders within this repository.
